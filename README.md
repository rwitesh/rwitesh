Hi, I'm Rwitesh Bera 👋

A software engineer based in India, deeply fascinated by backend engineering, databases, and software architectures.

I work in the Observability space, building systems that help teams monitor their infrastructure. My day-to-day involves tools like OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, ClickHouse, Golang, Docker, and more.

🔨 Currently building **[DataCia](https://www.datacia.app/)** — a database GUI.

This GitHub is my personal space to showcase projects, experiments, and things I'm actively exploring.
