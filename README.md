Hi, I'm Rwitesh Bera. I’m a software engineer based in India.   Back when I was in school, we had an old Windows PC at home, and I used to spend hours playing retro games on it. That’s what made me fall in love with computers and that fascination has only grown over the years.

### A bit about my journey...

Although I didn’t come from a well-known college, I’ve always believed that with the power of the internet, anyone can learn anything. All it takes is discipline, attention, patience, and a lot of reading and practice. That mindset led me to pursue a career in computer science & engineering.

I completed my Bachelor's in June 2024 and began my professional journey. My first job was in Bengaluru, where I worked for a year, including my internship.  I then moved to my current role, where I work remotely and focus on **Observability** in software systems.

### What I do…

In my current role, I work with a variety of tools and technologies that help monitor, track, and optimize the performance of applications and infrastructure. Some of the tools I work with include **OpenTelemetry**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **ClickHouse**, **Docker**, and **Golang**. I’m involved in building and maintaining an observability platform that helps teams to monitor their infrastructure, gain insights, and ensure systems run smoothly at scale.

### Always learning...

I love reading just about anything- whether it’s books, blogs, product guides. It’s something I do a lot because it keeps me constantly learning and exploring new ideas.
